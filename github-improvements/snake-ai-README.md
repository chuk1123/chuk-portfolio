## 🧠 Model Architecture

### Deep Q-Network Structure
```
Input Layer:    11 neurons (game state features)
Hidden Layer 1: 256 neurons (ReLU activation)
Hidden Layer 2: 256 neurons (ReLU activation)  
Output Layer:   3 neurons (action probabilities)
```

### State Representation
The AI receives 11 input features describing the current game state:
- **Danger Detection**: Collision risks in 3 directions (straight, left, right)
- **Movement Direction**: Current direction of the snake (4 boolean values)
- **Food Location**: Relative position of food (4 directional values)

### Action Space
- **Action 0**: Continue straight
- **Action 1**: Turn right
- **Action 2**: Turn left

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch
- **Game Engine**: Pygame
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, IPython
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Collections

### Algorithm: Deep Q-Learning
```python
# Core DQN Algorithm
Q(s,a) = reward + γ * max(Q(s',a'))

# Where:
# s  = current state
# a  = action taken
# s' = next state
# γ  = discount factor (0.9)
```

### Training Process
1. **Initialize** Q-network with random weights
2. **Observe** current game state
3. **Choose** action using ε-greedy policy
4. **Execute** action and observe reward
5. **Store** experience in replay buffer
6. **Sample** batch from replay buffer
7. **Update** Q-network using gradient descent
8. **Repeat** until convergence

## 🔬 Deep Dive: Neural Network Insights

### Feature Engineering
The state representation was carefully designed:
```python
def get_state(self):
    state = [
        # Danger straight, right, left
        self.is_collision(point_straight),
        self.is_collision(point_right), 
        self.is_collision(point_left),
        
        # Move direction
        self.direction == Direction.LEFT,
        self.direction == Direction.RIGHT,
        self.direction == Direction.UP,
        self.direction == Direction.DOWN,
        
        # Food location relative to head
        self.food.x < self.head.x,  # food left
        self.food.x > self.head.x,  # food right
        self.food.y < self.head.y,  # food up
        self.food.y > self.head.y   # food down
    ]
    return np.array(state, dtype=int)
```

### Reward Function
```python
def calculate_reward(self):
    if self.collision:
        return -10  # Penalty for collision
    elif self.food_eaten:
        return +10  # Reward for eating food
    else:
        return 0    # Neutral for normal moves
```
